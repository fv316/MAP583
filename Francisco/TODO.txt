Research- in order of importance:
1. Variable length RNN inputs. Use masking e.g. Word-2-Vector class example. 
2. Use downsampling of normal class to achieve better performance.
3. Create a RNN model using GRU and LSTM.
4. Try to use data augmentation and visualization.
5. Research using generative adversarial networks.



Already done:
Create a simple 1D-CNN model.
