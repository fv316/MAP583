Research- in order of importance-ish:
Variable length RNN inputs. Use masking e.g. Word-2-Vector class example. 
Use downsampling of normal class to achieve better performance.
Create a RNN model using GRU and LSTM.
Visualize the ROC curve and F1 scores.
Try to use data augmentation and visualization.
Research using generative adversarial networks.
Apply new loss functions.


Already done:
Create a simple 1D-CNN model.
